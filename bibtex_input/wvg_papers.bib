abstract = {Summary
Detailed single-neuron modeling is widely used to study neuronal functions. While cellular and functional diversity across the mammalian cortex is vast, most of the available computational tools focus on a limited set of specific features characteristic of a single neuron. Here, we present a generalized automated workflow for the creation of robust electrical models and illustrate its performance by building cell models for the rat somatosensory cortex. Each model is based on a 3D morphological reconstruction and a set of ionic mechanisms. We use an evolutionary algorithm to optimize neuronal parameters to match the electrophysiological features extracted from experimental data. Then we validate the optimized models against additional stimuli and assess their generalizability on a population of similar morphologies. Compared to the state-of-the-art canonical models, our models show 5-fold improved generalizability. This versatile approach can be used to build robust models of any neuronal type.}

  abstract = {Abstract             Pyramidal cells (PCs) form the backbone of the layered structure of the neocortex, and plasticity of their synapses is thought to underlie learning in the brain. However, such long-term synaptic changes have been experimentally characterized between only a few types of PCs, posing a significant barrier for studying neocortical learning mechanisms. Here we introduce a model of synaptic plasticity based on data-constrained postsynaptic calcium dynamics, and show in a neocortical microcircuit model that a single parameter set is sufficient to unify the available experimental findings on long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) of PC connections. In particular, we find that the diverse plasticity outcomes across the different PC types can be explained by cell-type-specific synaptic physiology, cell morphology and innervation patterns, without requiring type-specific plasticity. Generalizing the model to in vivo extracellular calcium concentrations, we predict qualitatively different plasticity dynamics from those observed in vitro. This work provides a first comprehensive null model for LTP/LTD between neocortical PC types in vivo, and an open framework for further developing models of cortical synaptic plasticity.},

  abstract = {Identifying the cell types constituting brain circuits is a fundamental question in neuroscience and motivates the generation of taxonomies based on electrophysiological, morphological and molecular single cell properties. Establishing the correspondence across data modalities and understanding the underlying principles has proven challenging. Bio-realistic computational models offer the ability to probe cause-and-effect and have historically been used to explore phenomena at the single-neuron level. Here we introduce a computational optimization workflow used for the generation and evaluation of more than 130 million single neuron models with active conductances. These models were based on 230 in vitro electrophysiological experiments followed by morphological reconstruction from the mouse visual cortex. We show that distinct ion channel conductance vectors exist that distinguish between major cortical classes with passive and h-channel conductances emerging as particularly important for classification. Next, using models of genetically defined classes, we show that differences in specific conductances predicted from the models reflect differences in gene expression in excitatory and inhibitory cell types as experimentally validated by single-cell RNA-sequencing. The differences in these conductances, in turn, explain many of the electrophysiological differences observed between cell types. Finally, we show the robustness of the herein generated single-cell models as representations and realizations of specific cell types in face of biological variability and optimization complexity. Our computational effort generated models that reconcile major single-cell data modalities that define cell types allowing for causal relationships to be examined.},

  abstract = {Neuronal morphologies provide the foundation for the electrical behavior of neurons, the connectomes they form, and the dynamical properties of the brain. Comprehensive neuron models are essential for defining cell types, discerning their functional roles, and investigating brain-disease-related dendritic alterations. However, a lack of understanding of the principles underlying neuron morphologies has hindered attempts to computationally synthesize morphologies for decades. We introduce a synthesis algorithm based on a topological descriptor of neurons, which enables the rapid digital reconstruction of entire brain regions from few reference cells. This topology-guided synthesis generates dendrites that are statistically similar to biological reconstructions in terms of morpho-electrical and connectivity properties and offers a significant opportunity to investigate the links between neuronal morphology and brain function across different spatiotemporal scales. Synthesized cortical networks based on structurally altered dendrites associated with diverse brain pathologies revealed principles linking branching properties to the structure of large-scale networks.},

  abstract = {Many scientific systems are studied using computer codes that simulate the phenomena of interest. Computer simulation enables scientists to study a broad range of possible conditions, generating large quantities of data at a faster rate than the laboratory. Computer models are widespread in neuroscience, where they are used to mimic brain function at different levels. These models offer a variety of new possibilities for the neuroscientist, but also numerous challenges, such as: where to sample the input space for the simulator, how to make sense of the data that is generated, and how to estimate unknown parameters in the model. Statistical emulation can be a valuable complement to simulator-based research. Emulators are able to mimic the simulator, often with a much smaller computational burden and they are especially valuable for parameter estimation, which may require many simulator evaluations. This work compares different statistical models that address these challenges, and applies them to simulations of neocortical L2/3 large basket cells, created and run with the NEURON simulator in the context of the European Human Brain Project. The novelty of our approach is the use of fast empirical emulators, which have the ability to accelerate the optimization process for the simulator and to identify which inputs (in this case, different membrane ion channels) are most influential in affecting simulated features. These contributions are complementary, as knowledge of the important features can further improve the optimization process. Subsequent research, conducted after the process is completed, will gain efficiency by focusing on these inputs.},

  abstract = {Anatomically and biophysically detailed data-driven neuronal models have become widely used tools for understanding and predicting the behavior and function of neurons. Due to the increasing availability of experimental data from anatomical and electrophysiological measurements as well as the growing number of computational and software tools that enable accurate neuronal modeling, there are now a large number of different models of many cell types available in the literature. These models were usually built to capture a few important or interesting properties of the given neuron type, and it is often unknown how they would behave outside their original context. In addition, there is currently no simple way of quantitatively comparing different models regarding how closely they match specific experimental observations. This limits the evaluation, re-use and further development of the existing models. Further, the development of new models could also be significantly facilitated by the ability to rapidly test the behavior of model candidates against the relevant collection of experimental data. We address these problems for the representative case of the CA1 pyramidal cell of the rat hippocampus by developing an open-source Python test suite, which makes it possible to automatically and systematically test multiple properties of models by making quantitative comparisons between the models and electrophysiological data. The tests cover various aspects of somatic behavior, and signal propagation and integration in apical dendrites. To demonstrate the utility of our approach, we applied our tests to compare the behavior of several different rat hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cell models from the ModelDB database against electrophysiological data available in the literature, and evaluated how well these models match experimental observations in different domains. We also show how we employed the test suite to aid the development of models within the European Human Brain Project (HBP), and describe the integration of the tests into the validation framework developed in the HBP, with the aim of facilitating more reproducible and transparent model building in the neuroscience community.},

  abstract = {In realistic neuronal modeling, once the ionic channel complement has been defined, the maximum ionic conductance (Gi-max) values need to be tuned in order to match the firing pattern revealed by electrophysiological recordings. Recently, selection/mutation genetic algorithms have been proposed to efficiently and automatically tune these parameters. Nonetheless, since similar firing patterns can be achieved through different combinations of Gi-max values, it is not clear how well these algorithms approximate the corresponding properties of real cells. Here we have evaluated the issue by exploiting a unique opportunity offered by the cerebellar granule cell (GrC), which is electrotonically compact and has therefore allowed the direct experimental measurement of ionic currents. Previous models were constructed using empirical tuning of Gi-max values to match the original data set. Here, by using repetitive discharge patterns as a template, the optimization procedure yielded models that closely approximated the experimental Gi-max values. These models, in addition to repetitive firing, captured additional features, including inward rectification, near-threshold oscillations, and resonance, which were not used as features. Thus, parameter optimization using genetic algorithms provided an efficient modeling strategy for reconstructing the biophysical properties of neurons and for the subsequent reconstruction of large-scale neuronal network models.},
