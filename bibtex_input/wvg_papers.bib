    abstract = "{In computational neuroscience, multicompartment models are among the most biophysically realistic representations of single neurons. Constructing such models usually involves the use of the patch-clamp technique to record somatic voltage signals under different experimental conditions. The experimental data are then used to fit the many parameters of the model. While patching of the soma is currently the gold-standard approach to build multicompartment models, several studies have also evidenced a richness of dynamics in dendritic and axonal sections. Recording from the soma alone makes it hard to observe and correctly parameterize the activity of nonsomatic compartments. In order to provide a richer set of data as input to multicompartment models, we here investigate the combination of somatic patch-clamp recordings with recordings of high-density microelectrode arrays (HD-MEAs). HD-MEAs enable the observation of extracellular potentials and neural activity of neuronal compartments at subcellular resolution.In this work, we introduce a novel framework to combine patch-clamp and HD-MEA data to construct multicompartment models. We first validate our method on a ground-truth model with known parameters and show that the use of features extracted from extracellular signals, in addition to intracellular ones, yields models enabling better fits than using intracellular features alone. We also demonstrate our procedure using experimental data by constructing cell models from in vitro cell cultures.The proposed multimodal fitting procedure has the potential to augment the modeling efforts of the computational neuroscience community and provide the field with neuronal models that are more realistic and can be better validated.}",

    abstract = "{We derived computationally efficient average response models of different types of cortical neurons, which are subject to external electric fields from Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation. We used 24 reconstructions of pyramidal cells (PC) from layer 2/3, 245 small, nested, and large basket cells from layer 4, and 30 PC from layer 5 with different morphologies for deriving average models. With these models, it is possible to efficiently estimate the stimulation thresholds depending on the underlying electric field distribution in the brain, without having to implement and compute complex neuron compartment models. The stimulation thresholds were determined by exposing the neurons to TMS-induced electric fields with different angles, intensities, pulse waveforms, and field decays along the somato-dendritic axis. The derived average response models were verified by reference simulations using a high-resolution realistic head model containing several million neurons. The relative errors of the estimated thresholds between the average model and the reference model ranged between -3\\% and 3.7\\% in 98\\% of the cases, while the computation time was only a fraction of a second compared to several weeks. Finally, we compared the model behavior to TMS experiments and observed high correspondence to the orientation sensitivity of motor evoked potentials. The derived models were compared to the classical cortical column cosine model and to simplified ball-and-stick neurons. It was shown that both models oversimplify the complex interplay between the electric field and the neurons and do not adequately represent the directional sensitivity of the different cell typesThe derived models are simple to apply and only require the TMS induced electric field in the brain as input variable. The models and code are available to the general public in open-source repositories for integration into TMS studies to estimate the expected stimulation thresholds for an improved dosing and treatment planning in the future}",

Detailed single-neuron modeling is widely used to study neuronal functions. While cellular and functional diversity across the mammalian cortex is vast, most of the available computational tools focus on a limited set of specific features characteristic of a single neuron. Here, we present a generalized automated workflow for the creation of robust electrical models and illustrate its performance by building cell models for the rat somatosensory cortex. Each model is based on a 3D morphological reconstruction and a set of ionic mechanisms. We use an evolutionary algorithm to optimize neuronal parameters to match the electrophysiological features extracted from experimental data. Then we validate the optimized models against additional stimuli and assess their generalizability on a population of similar morphologies. Compared to the state-of-the-art canonical models, our models show 5-fold improved generalizability. This versatile approach can be used to build robust models of any neuronal type.}

We found two one-channel and six multi-channel clusters in mouse visual cortex with distinct in vivo properties in terms of activity, cortical depth, and behavior. We used biophysical models to map the two one- and the six multi-channel clusters to specific in vitro classes with unique morphology, excitability and conductance properties that explain their distinct extracellular signatures and functional characteristics. These concepts were tested in ground-truth optotagging experiments with two inhibitory classes unveiling distinct in vivo properties.

Thalamoreticular circuitry plays a key role in arousal, attention, cognition, and sleep spindles, and is linked to several brain disorders. A detailed computational model of mouse somatosensory thalamus and thalamic reticular nucleus has been developed to capture the properties of over 14,000 neurons connected by 6 million synapses. The model recreates the biological connectivity of these neurons, and simulations of the model reproduce multiple experimental findings in different brain states. The model shows that inhibitory rebound produces frequency-selective enhancement of thalamic responses during wakefulness. We find that thalamic interactions are responsible for the characteristic waxing and waning of spindle oscillations. In addition, we find that changes in thalamic excitability control spindle frequency and their incidence. The model is made openly available to provide a new tool for studying the function and dysfunction of the thalamoreticular circuitry in various brain states.}

However, such long-term synaptic changes have been experimentally characterized between only a few types of PCs, posing a significant barrier for studying neocortical learning mechanisms. Here we introduce a model of synaptic plasticity based on data-constrained postsynaptic calcium dynamics, and show in a neocortical microcircuit model that a single parameter set is sufficient to unify the available experimental findings on long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) of PC connections. In particular, we find that the diverse plasticity outcomes across the different PC types can be explained by cell-type-specific synaptic physiology, cell morphology and innervation patterns, without requiring type-specific plasticity. Generalizing the model to in vivo extracellular calcium concentrations, we predict qualitatively different plasticity dynamics from those observed in vitro. This work provides a first comprehensive null model for LTP/LTD between neocortical PC types in vivo, and an open framework for further developing models of cortical synaptic plasticity.},

Which cell types constitute brain circuits is a fundamental question, but establishing the correspondence across cellular data modalities is challenging. Bio-realistic models allow probing cause-and-effect and linking seemingly disparate modalities. Here, we introduce a computational optimization workflow to generate 9,200 single-neuron models with active conductances. These models are based on 230 in vitro electrophysiological experiments followed by morphological reconstruction from the mouse visual cortex. We show that, in contrast to current belief, the generated models are robust representations of individual experiments and cortical cell types as defined via cellular electrophysiology or transcriptomics. Next, we show that differences in specific conductances predicted from the models reflect differences in gene expression supported by single-cell transcriptomics. The differences in model conductances, in turn, explain electrophysiological differences observed between the cortical subclasses. Our computational effort reconciles single-cell modalities that define cell types and enables causal relationships to be examined.}

Comprehensive neuron models are essential for defining cell types, discerning their functional roles, and investigating brain-disease-related dendritic alterations. However, a lack of understanding of the principles underlying neuron morphologies has hindered attempts to computationally synthesize morphologies for decades. We introduce a synthesis algorithm based on a topological descriptor of neurons, which enables the rapid digital reconstruction of entire brain regions from few reference cells. This topology-guided synthesis generates dendrites that are statistically similar to biological reconstructions in terms of morpho-electrical and connectivity properties and offers a significant opportunity to investigate the links between neuronal morphology and brain function across different spatiotemporal scales. Synthesized cortical networks based on structurally altered dendrites associated with diverse brain pathologies revealed principles linking branching properties to the structure of large-scale networks.},

Computer simulation enables scientists to study a broad range of possible conditions, generating large quantities of data at a faster rate than the laboratory. Computer models are widespread in neuroscience, where they are used to mimic brain function at different levels. These models offer a variety of new possibilities for the neuroscientist, but also numerous challenges, such as: where to sample the input space for the simulator, how to make sense of the data that is generated, and how to estimate unknown parameters in the model. Statistical emulation can be a valuable complement to simulator-based research. Emulators are able to mimic the simulator, often with a much smaller computational burden and they are especially valuable for parameter estimation, which may require many simulator evaluations. This work compares different statistical models that address these challenges, and applies them to simulations of neocortical L2/3 large basket cells, created and run with the NEURON simulator in the context of the European Human Brain Project. The novelty of our approach is the use of fast empirical emulators, which have the ability to accelerate the optimization process for the simulator and to identify which inputs (in this case, different membrane ion channels) are most influential in affecting simulated features. These contributions are complementary, as knowledge of the important features can further improve the optimization process. Subsequent research, conducted after the process is completed, will gain efficiency by focusing on these inputs.},

  abstract = {Anatomically and biophysically detailed data-driven neuronal models have become widely used tools for understanding and predicting the behavior and function of neurons. Due to the increasing availability of experimental data from anatomical and electrophysiological measurements as well as the growing number of computational and software tools that enable accurate neuronal modeling, there are now a large number of different models of many cell types available in the literature. These models were usually built to capture a few important or interesting properties of the given neuron type, and it is often unknown how they would behave outside their original context. In addition, there is currently no simple way of quantitatively comparing different models regarding how closely they match specific experimental observations. This limits the evaluation, re-use and further development of the existing models. Further, the development of new models could also be significantly facilitated by the ability to rapidly test the behavior of model candidates against the relevant collection of experimental data. We address these problems for the representative case of the CA1 pyramidal cell of the rat hippocampus by developing an open-source Python test suite, which makes it possible to automatically and systematically test multiple properties of models by making quantitative comparisons between the models and electrophysiological data. The tests cover various aspects of somatic behavior, and signal propagation and integration in apical dendrites. To demonstrate the utility of our approach, we applied our tests to compare the behavior of several different rat hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cell models from the ModelDB database against electrophysiological data available in the literature, and evaluated how well these models match experimental observations in different domains. We also show how we employed the test suite to aid the development of models within the European Human Brain Project (HBP), and describe the integration of the tests into the validation framework developed in the HBP, with the aim of facilitating more reproducible and transparent model building in the neuroscience community.},

  abstract = {In realistic neuronal modeling, once the ionic channel complement has been defined, the maximum ionic conductance (Gi-max) values need to be tuned in order to match the firing pattern revealed by electrophysiological recordings. Recently, selection/mutation genetic algorithms have been proposed to efficiently and automatically tune these parameters. Nonetheless, since similar firing patterns can be achieved through different combinations of Gi-max values, it is not clear how well these algorithms approximate the corresponding properties of real cells. Here we have evaluated the issue by exploiting a unique opportunity offered by the cerebellar granule cell (GrC), which is electrotonically compact and has therefore allowed the direct experimental measurement of ionic currents. Previous models were constructed using empirical tuning of Gi-max values to match the original data set. Here, by using repetitive discharge patterns as a template, the optimization procedure yielded models that closely approximated the experimental Gi-max values. These models, in addition to repetitive firing, captured additional features, including inward rectification, near-threshold oscillations, and resonance, which were not used as features. Thus, parameter optimization using genetic algorithms provided an efficient modeling strategy for reconstructing the biophysical properties of neurons and for the subsequent reconstruction of large-scale neuronal network models.},

  abstract = "We present a first-draft digital reconstruction of the
              microcircuitry of somatosensory cortex of juvenile rat. The
              reconstruction uses cellular and synaptic organizing principles
              to algorithmically reconstruct detailed anatomy and physiology
              from sparse experimental data. An objective anatomical method
              defines a neocortical volume of 0.29 $\pm$ 0.01 mm(3) containing
              ~31,000 neurons, and patch-clamp studies identify 55
              layer-specific morphological and 207 morpho-electrical neuron
              subtypes. When digitally reconstructed neurons are positioned in
              the volume and synapse formation is restricted to biological
              bouton densities and numbers of synapses per connection, their
              overlapping arbors form ~8 million connections with ~37 million
              synapses. Simulations reproduce an array of in vitro and in vivo
              experiments without parameter tuning. Additionally, we find a
              spectrum of network states with a sharp transition from
              synchronous to asynchronous activity, modulated by physiological
              mechanisms. The spectrum of network states, dynamically
              reconfigured around this transition, supports diverse information
              processing strategies. PAPERCLIP: VIDEO ABSTRACT.",
