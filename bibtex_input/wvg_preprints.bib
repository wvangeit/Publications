  abstract = {In recent years, large-scale computational models of the cortex have emerged as a powerful way to study the multi-scale mechanisms of neural processing. However, due to computational costs and difficulty of parameterization, detailed biophysical reconstructions have so far been restricted to small volumes of tissue, where the study of macro- and meso-scale interactions that are central to cortical function is not possible. We describe here, and in a companion paper, an approach to address the scaling challenges and provide a model of multiple interacting cortical regions at a subcellular level of detail. The model consists of 4.2 million morphologically detailed neurons in 8 sub-regions and connected with 13.2 billion synapses through local and long-range connectivity. Its anatomical aspects are described in the companion paper; here, we introduce physiological models of neuronal activity and synaptic transmission that integrate a large number of literature sources and were built using previously published algorithms. Biological neuronal diversity was captured in 208 morpho-electrical neuron types, five types of synaptic short-term dynamics, and pathway-specificity of synaptic parameters. A representation of synaptic input from cortical regions not present in the model was added and efficiently calibrated to reference firing rates. The model exhibits a spectrum of dynamical states differing in the degree to which they are internally versus externally driven. We characterized which parts of the spectrum are compatible with available experimental data on layer-specific delays and amplitudes of responses to simple stimuli, and found an in vivo-like regime at the edge of a transition from asynchronous to synchronous spontaneous activity. We developed a rich set of simulation tools to recreate a diverse set of laboratory experiments in silico, providing further validation and demonstrating the utility of the model in a variety of paradigms. Finally, we found that the large spatial scale of the model, that incorporates multiple cortical regions, led to the emergence of multiple independent computational units interacting through long-range synaptic pathways. The model provides a framework for the continued integration of experimental findings, for challenging hypotheses and making testable predictions, and provides a foundation for further simulation-based studies of cortical processing and learning.},

  abstract = {Abstract                        The CA1 region of the hippocampus is one of the most studied regions of the rodent brain, thought to play an important role in cognitive functions such as memory and spatial navigation. Despite a wealth of experimental data on its structure and function, it can be challenging to reconcile information obtained from diverse experimental approaches. To address this challenge, we present a community-driven, full-scale             in silico             model of the rat CA1 that integrates a broad range of experimental data, from synapse to network, including the reconstruction of its principal afferents, the Schaffer collaterals, and a model of the effects that acetylcholine has on the system. We have tested and validated each model component and the final network model, and made input data, assumptions, and strategies explicit and transparent. The flexibility of the model allows scientists to address a range of scientific questions. In this article, we describe the methods used to set up simulations that reproduce and extend             in vitro             and             in vivo             experiments. Among several applications in the article, we focus on theta rhythm, a prominent hippocampal oscillation associated with various behavioral correlates and use our computer model to reproduce and reconcile experimental findings. Finally, we make data, code and model available through the hippocampushub.eu portal, which also provides an extensive set of analyses of the model and a user-friendly interface to facilitate adoption and usage. This neuroscience community-driven model represents a valuable tool for integrating diverse experimental data and provides a foundation for further research into the complex workings of the hippocampal CA1 region.},

  abstract = {In computational neuroscience, multicompartment models are among the most biophysically realistic representations of single neurons. Constructing such models usually involves the use of the patch-clamp technique to record somatic voltage signals under different experimental conditions. The experimental data are then used to fit the many parameters of the model. While patching of the soma is currently the gold-standard approach to build multicompartment models, several studies have also evidenced a richness of dynamics in dendritic and axonal sections. Recording from the soma alone makes it hard to observe and correctly parameterize the activity of non-somatic compartments.},
